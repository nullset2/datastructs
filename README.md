# datastructs
Some shitty pure C data structures.

I make no claims of rights over this code and I intend to share it with the community in hopes that anyone may find usefulness in it. Feel free to use liberally, with no attribution of any kind needed, this code is almost worthless anyway sans for, perhaps, some oblique educational value in the thoroughness of the comments in the files, describing everything the scripts do in almost painful detail for data structure compsci student newbies.

Maybe this will help people grasp a different way to tackle on problems and solve them? I dunno.
